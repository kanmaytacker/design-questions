# Design BookMyShow

## Context

BookMyShow is India's biggest online movie and events ticketing brand. The website caters to ticket sales for movies, plays, concerts and sporting events via the online platform.

BookMyShow is an online ticketing facility like Movietickets.com, Explara and Ticketmaster.com. BookMyShow took the primary services provided by these two websites and consolidated it into one website for movies, plays, events and sports tickets. Apart from being an online ticketing portal, BookMyShow offers information about upcoming movies and events, show timings, venue details and artist bios.

## Requirements gathering

What are some questions you would ask to gather requirements?

```
```

## Requirements

Build an online movie ticket booking system that can support the following requirements:
```
```

## Use case diagrams

Are the requirements clear enough to define use cases?
If not, try to think of the actors and their interactions with the system.

### Actors

What would be the actors in this system?

```
```

### Use cases

What would be the use cases i.e. the interactions between the actors and the system?

#### Actor 1

Name of actor - ``

Use cases:
```
```

#### Actor 2

```
```

---

Draw the use case diagram.


## Class diagrams

What will be the major classes and their attributes?

```
    Class name
        - Attribute 1
        - Attribute 2
        ...
```

Draw the class diagram.
```
```

## API design

What will be some APIs that you would design for this system?

Look at the use cases and try to design APIs for each of them.

You can simply write the APIs in the following format:
`API name` - `HTTP method` - `URL` - `?Request body` - `?Response body`

You could also use a tool like [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to design the APIs or follow [this](https://github.com/jamescooke/restapidocs) repository for a simple way to use Markdown to structure your API documentation.
